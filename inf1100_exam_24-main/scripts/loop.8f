(a "simple" loop that counts to 10)
1                           (start at 1)
  .dup .print .newline      (print the current number)  
  1 .+                      (add 1) 
  .dup  11 .swap .>?       (is 11 > n?) 
-10 .cjump                  (then jump 10 words back -- count carefully) 
~end of loop here~ .print .newline
